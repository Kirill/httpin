# required

**required** is a [directive executor](/advanced/concepts#directive-executor) who tags a field as required.

## Definition

```yaml
Name: "required"
Args: (no args)
```

**required** always works as an accompany with some other directives, it checks if the field were set by the former directives. When the field were not set by the former directives, an error [ErrMissingField](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ggicci/httpin#pkg-variables) will occur.

## Usage

```go
type TokenInput struct {
	Token string `in:"query=access_token;required"`
}
```

<InputOutputTable
  inputTitle={data.inputOutput.inputTitle}
  outputTitle={data.inputOutput.outputTitle}
  rows={data.inputOutput.rows}
></InputOutputTable>
